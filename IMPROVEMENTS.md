# LFI — Improvements Tracker

Status: **LIVE TRAINING**
Last updated: 2026-04-14 (756 tests, 0 failures, 70+ modules, 49 training domains, Ollama LIVE)

## CURRENT MILESTONE: Real Ollama Training Confirmed Working

LFI successfully ran real inference training against qwen2.5-coder:7b on 2026-04-14.
Pilot run: 20/22 correct on math domain (90.9%, real LLM latency ~7s/query warm).
The "wrong" answers were whitespace format mismatches, now fixed.

## Roadmap — Active Development

### In Progress

#### Real Ollama Inference Training
Connect InferenceTrainer to actual Ollama models (deepseek-r1:8b, qwen2.5-coder:7b) and run the 300-example training pipeline with real LLM answers. Measure accuracy, analyze error patterns, feed corrections into KnowledgeEngine.

#### Training Data Augmentation
Auto-generate question variations from existing 300 examples. Rephrasings, harder versions, and related questions. Target: 300→1000+ effective examples. Template-based and domain-specific transformations.

#### Adversarial Training Examples
Deliberately tricky, misleading, and edge-case questions across all 38 domains. Common misconceptions, ambiguous phrasings, trap questions. Teaches LFI to handle real-world messy inputs.

### Planned — High Priority

#### Self-Play Provenance Integration
Wire traces into MCTS thesis-antithesis-synthesis self-play episodes. Each synthesis records a full trace chain. Traces persist across episodes for strategy evolution analysis.

#### Knowledge Graph Export
Serialize the learned concept graph (concepts, relationships, mastery levels) as DOT/JSON for visualization. Show what LFI knows and how concepts connect.

#### Provenance Serialization
`serde::Serialize` / `Deserialize` on `TraceEntry` and `TraceArena`. Traces survive process restarts via the knowledge persistence layer.

#### Provenance Query API
REST endpoints via `api.rs`:
- `GET /provenance/:conclusion_id` → ProvenancedExplanation
- `GET /provenance/:conclusion_id/chain` → Vec<TraceEntry>
- `GET /provenance/stats` → total traces, traced vs reconstructed ratio

### Planned — Medium Priority

#### Spaced Repetition Scheduler
Time-based concept review scheduling. Track when concepts were last reinforced, schedule re-testing of decaying concepts. Optimal review intervals based on mastery and forgetting curve.

#### Distributed Inference
Split training work across multiple Ollama instances on different machines. Useful when laptop + VPS both run Ollama.

#### GPU Compute Backend
`hdc/compute.rs` has `ComputeBackend` trait with only `LocalBackend`. Add CUDA/Vulkan backend for 3050Ti acceleration of VSA operations.

#### Android/NDK Build
Cross-compile for Pixel 10 Pro XL via NDK. Lightweight inference on mobile with knowledge checkpoint sync.

#### Formal Verification
Kani or TLA+ integration for PSL axiom system and provenance invariants — ideal candidates for formal verification.

### Planned — Low Priority (Post-1.0)

#### Phase 5B: WebSocket API for Live Telemetry
Real-time training progress streaming to dashboard.

#### Phase 5C: Frontend Dashboard
Web UI for monitoring training runs, knowledge state, error patterns.

#### Phase 5D: Remote GPU Backend
Cloud GPU offloading for heavy VSA operations.

#### Phase 5E: End-to-End Sensorium Integration
Full multimodal pipeline: audio + image + text → VSA → reasoning → output.
